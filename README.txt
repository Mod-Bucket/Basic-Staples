Basic Staples
Version .01

A mod for Staxel.

==========

What is Basic Staples?

That depends on who you are. 

If you're a player, it's a mod that fills in the holes in the cooking system of Staxel. It will let you bake bread, make cheese, and has recipes that use every basic crop in the game. If you have other mods installed that Staples supports you may find new recipes that combine ingredients from multiple mods. At the same time: Staples won't clog up your catalog with useless ingredients. If you can lay your hands on it then there should be a recipe that can use the item. If you're a player, that's pretty much all you need to know! Check the section on pets just below this one if you aren't happy with the tweaks to pet gifting behavior. If you're concerned about compatability see the section after that. Go have fun!

If you're a modder, Staples gives you access to new ingredients from other mods that it supports without needing to release weird compatability patch mods. It doesn't give you access to most things that would be considered an "end product" unless that could reasonably be used to make something else (Like how carrot cakes can be made into a wedding cake in vanilla Staxel.) For how the system works see the "for modders" section at the end of the file.

=======

On Pets:

This mod adds patches to the pet files so that they will each drop ONLY their own special kind of pet seed. Patches are included for the dragon pet and Xable's pet mods. If you want the Bunny Carrot, Puppy Potato, and Cat Turnip to be dropped by all pets then delete the PetPatches folder. The vanilla pet treasure list has been patched to add the bunny carrot and puppy potato to the standard pet gift list. This file should be left alone as it is the only way to get bunny carrots and puppy potatoes.

==========

Mods Basic Staples interacts with:

Fully Supported*:  
	- Easter Fest:
		* Patches out a few duplicate recipes and cloned some ingredients and the bunny carrot. 
		* Eggwood is not a food crop and will never be cloned.
		* Filligree Rabbits already only drop bunny carrot seeds. 
		* The Easter Fest plant is patched to drop Basic Staples Bunny Carrots. 
		* You might wind up with two stacks of bunny carrot seeds. Both produce the same crop item.
	- Dragon Pets:
		* Added a patch so that the dragons use a special dragon table. 
		* Dragons drop all three pet seeds and treasures instead of clothing.
	- Xable's Animals - Patches added to redirect the pet drop tables.

*A fully supported mod has patches to ensure no conflicting recipes and might have copies of ingredients and crops placed within the Basic Staples mod to make them accessible to other mods. ALL OBJECTS OR ITEMS CONTAINED IN BASIC STAPLES ARE HERE WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ORIGINAL MODDER AND THEIR WORK IS LISTED IN THE CREDITS SECTION.

---------

Partly Supported**:
	
	OilC:
		* Patches make both oils equivalent to Staple's oil for the purposes of making cooking oil. 
		* OilC oils may or may not work if another mod decides to use oils other than "cooking oil."
		* OilC's crusher will make Staples's oils. 
		* The Crusher is much more efficent than Staple's mill so there is incentive to use it. 
		* OilC's recipes report an incorrect results quantity. You get twice as much oil.
		* Removed OilC's recipes from sale. It's pretty obvious how it works.

	StaxelBasicRecipes:
		* Removed conflicting flour reactions and hid recipes. 
		* Do not recommend using this mod's cocoa recipe. Fast but not economical. 
		* The animal food recipes are entirely different. Flexibility!

	Auto Magic:
		* Patches added to redirect the pet drop tables.
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
		
**A partly supported mod might have some recipe conflicts with Basic Staples that have been patched out. Some items in the mod might be duplicates of Basic Staples items and additional reactions may have been added to make the duplicates work in Staple recipes. Incorrect recipes May have been patched out. The mod may have ingredients that are unavailable for use with other mods. Mods that use Basic Staples might forget to include reactions for some of this mod's ingredients. 

---------

Non-conflicting Mods***:
	Allie's Kitchen Pickles - (Staples has no pickles at the moment. This will change.)
	HomesteadButter
	Homestead Magic Water - Basic Staples does NOT have a Magic Water recipe.
	HoneyGlazedChips
	HoneyGlazedCarrots
	MoreHoney
	Pearl_Jam
	KK's Pizza
	StarJelly - Basic Staples does NOT have a Star Jelly recipe.
	StaxelCookieDough
		* Not useable in place of Staple's Cookie Dough because the game hates my attempts to make that happen.
	Waifu Bartending

***A non-conflicting mod has no recipes that directly interfere with Basic Staples. It may have different recipes that do the same thing, (like have a different method for making cheese,) but it doesn't cause any problems. Most of these mods either add a method to craft a vanilla item, or add items that Basic Staples doesn't have. It's possible some of these may move to another category if they're updated with new items or Basic Staple's roadmap changes. 

---------

Unsupported Mods****:
	auto baker/boiler/fryer/mixer/chopper:
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
	Autokitchen by NiccyNeko:
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
	Coffee in Staxel:
		* Coffee Maker would require significant editing to be compatable with Basic Staples coffee.
		* Maybe someday.
	Dairy:
		* Lots of overlap with Basic Staples. 
		* Full compatability will require coordination with Ro-Z.
		* Even partial compatability will be a large project.
	Expanded Recipes:
		* Full compatability will require coordination with 09Iraida.
		* Partial compatability will be a large project.
	

****An unsupported mod either has fundamental and irreconcilable differences with Basic Staples and/or the mod author has specifically asked Mod Bucket not to pursue compatability with their mod. (Or we just haven't gotten to making patches yet!) There may be recipe conflicts, or there may not be. Any issues arising from an unsupported mod will probably not be pursued.

IF YOU AREN'T A MODDER STOP READING HERE. THIS STUFF IS BORING AND UNIMPORTANT TO YOU.

==========================================================================================
==========================================================================================
==========================================================================================

For Modders:

First: If you have an item you want to add to Basic Staples so that the rest of the modding community can use it: Yay! Poke a Modbucket member on either the official or Mod Bucket discords (Probably Toketsupuurin as this is mostly maintained by her,) and they'll help you work through getting it into the mod.

Second: Basic Staples has been designed to win (almost certainly) any conflicts it has with another mod. It HAS to do this to fulfill its function of working with any mod that wants to play in its sandbox. If you have a recipe that desperately needs a single sweet potato being put in the blender to result in a potato mortar... well, sorry but everyone else needs the chopped sweet potato to cook food. If you're going to play in the sandbox, please respect the fact that other modders are/might be using this stuff too. If you're having a conflict like this: talk to a Bucketeer. We'll work with you to find a solution if we can, or we'll put your mod in the conflict list if we can't come to a mutually satisfying conclusion.

Third: Basic Staples has a lot of items and recipes that don't appear to the player. All of these items have "hiddenunlesspatched" in their codes. 

You have two options for handling these items & recipies:

	* Have a quest or something that gives the item to the player if you only want them to have a limited amount of it. Bear in mind someone else's mod might make an item visible to the player and they'll have free access to it then. 

OR

	* Write a small patch file that changes at least one of these values to true:

	    "catalogueUnlockedFromStart": false, //players get instant access
	    "buyable": false, //Players can buy it from the catalog. They can also buy it from a store if you change the store's pool contain it.
	    "searchable": false, //players can find it in the creative menu.
	    "canBeEarntFromLuckyBox": false //A lucky box will drop 1 of this item ONCE only if the player has never seen it. This will unlock it in the catalog if the item has buyable set to true.

	ONLY include a value you NEED to change. NEVER make a patch setting a value to false. Don't include any others. Set the patch's priority to "20", and the merge option to "true" unless you know what you're doing. Bear in mind, other mods need access to these items too so don't go changing other stuff that impacts an item's behavior. You can probably get away with changing the value or sell price, but don't assume those aren't changed by someone else. If you need a special version of an item for a quest that needs other attributes changed It's probably better to create a new item and link to the Basic Staples QB file.

------

Actually Adding Basic Staples items to your mod:

If you just want to use a Basic Staples item in your mod there are a few ways to go about it:

1. Make your mod dependent on Basic Staples. You can use any visible basic staples items normally and you can assume that any of the visible Staple recipes are available for your player. Add in patch files to activate any items or recipes you want your players to see. (PLEASE ONLY activate items you'll be actually using to make stuff in your mod. Don't flood the player with useless items.)

2. Make your mod independent of Basic Staples. DON'T do this for critical features of your mod. Do this only when the stuff that uses Basic Staples is like bonus content. You can safely do this with just reactions for hidden secrets for your players to find. Actually showing a recipe is trickier because if Basic Staples isn't installed the recipe will read incorrectly to the player, but if you poke a Bucketeer we can look into the possibility of adding a reciprocal patch into Basic Staples that will turn on a recipe. (This is not a preferred option, but there are circumstances where it might be acceptable to pursue, like if it's an already established mod.)

Caveats for specific ingredients:

We've tried really hard to avoid duplicate items in Basic Staples from other mods. It was inevitable that it would happen at some point though. Some mods Basic Staples will just tweak so that their recipes output a Staple product...but if the mod is small enough and it only produces 1-2 items then Staples would overwrite the entire mod so we didn't take that route.

Pickles: Any recipe that uses a "pickle" should probably have a variation for the pickle from Allie's mod. Technically Allie's pickles are fermented and Staple's pickles are "quick pickles" so they would be different  products in reality. If you have a good reason not to make them equivalent, (like having recipes for both kinds of pickle,) then don't. But if you just want some random form of pickle then make duplicate reactions but only a single recipe.

Corn Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Corn Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Sunflower Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Sunflower Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Cookie Dough: Any recipe that uses cookie dough should probably have a variation for the dough from StaxelCookieDough.
