Modbucket presents:

Basic Staples
Version .02

A mod for Staxel.

==========

What is Basic Staples?

That depends on who you are. 

If you're a player, it's a mod that fills in the holes in the cooking system of Staxel. It will let you bake bread, make cheese, and has recipes that use every basic crop in the game. If you have other mods installed that Staples supports you may find new recipes that combine ingredients from multiple mods. At the same time: Staples won't clog up your catalog with useless ingredients. If you can lay your hands on it then there should be a recipe that can use the item. If you're a player, that's pretty much all you need to know! Check the section on pets just below this one if you aren't happy with the tweaks to pet gifting behavior. If you're concerned about compatability see the section after that. Go have fun!

If you're a modder, Staples gives you access to new ingredients from other mods that it supports without needing to release weird compatability patch mods. It doesn't give you access to most things that would be considered an "end product" unless that could reasonably be used to make something else (Like how carrot cakes can be made into a wedding cake in vanilla Staxel.) For how the system works see the ForModder.txt file in the same folder as this readme.

=======

On Pets:

This mod adds patches to the pet files so that they will each drop ONLY their own special kind of pet seed. Patches are included for the dragon pet, Auto Magic and Xable's pet mods. If you want the Bunny Carrot, Puppy Potato, and Cat Turnip to be dropped by all pets then delete the PetPatches folder or the subfolder for any mod you don't want affected. The vanilla pet treasure list has been patched to add the bunny carrot and puppy potato to the standard pet gift list. (That patch isn't in the PetPatches folder so you don't need to worry about it.)

==========

Mods Basic Staples interacts with:

Fully Supported*:  
	- Easter Fest:
		* Patches out a few duplicate recipes and cloned some ingredients and the bunny carrot. 
		* Eggwood is not a food crop and will never be cloned.
		* Filligree Rabbits already only drop bunny carrot seeds. 
		* The Easter Fest plant is patched to drop Basic Staples Bunny Carrots. 
		* You might wind up with two stacks of bunny carrot seeds. Both produce the same crop item.
	- Dragon Pets:
		* Added a patch so that the dragons use a special dragon table. 
		* Dragons drop all three pet seeds and treasures instead of clothing.
	- Xable's Animals - Patches added to redirect the pet drop tables.

*A fully supported mod has patches to ensure no conflicting recipes and might have copies of ingredients and crops placed within the Basic Staples mod to make them accessible to other mods. ALL OBJECTS OR ITEMS CONTAINED IN BASIC STAPLES ARE HERE WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ORIGINAL MODDER AND THEIR WORK IS LISTED IN THE CREDITS SECTION.

---------

Partly Supported**:
	
	OilC:
		* Patches make both oils equivalent to Staple's oil for the purposes of making cooking oil. 
		* OilC oils may or may not work if another mod decides to use oils other than "cooking oil."
		* OilC's crusher will make Staples's oils. 
		* The Crusher is much more efficent than Staple's mill so there is incentive to use it. 
		* OilC's recipes report an incorrect results quantity. You get twice as much oil.
		* Removed OilC's recipes from sale. It's pretty obvious how it works.

	StaxelBasicRecipes:
		* Removed conflicting flour reactions and hid recipes. 
		* Do not recommend using this mod's cocoa recipe. Fast but not economical. 
		* The animal food recipes are entirely different. Flexibility!

	Auto Magic:
		* Patches added to redirect the pet drop tables.
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
		
**A partly supported mod might have some recipe conflicts with Basic Staples that have been patched out. Some items in the mod might be duplicates of Basic Staples items and additional reactions may have been added to make the duplicates work in Staple recipes. Incorrect recipes May have been patched out. The mod may have ingredients that are unavailable for use with other mods. Mods that use Basic Staples might forget to include reactions for some of this mod's ingredients. 

---------

Non-conflicting Mods***:
	Allie's Kitchen Pickles - (Staples has no pickles at the moment. This will change.)
	HomesteadButter
	Homestead Magic Water - Basic Staples does NOT have a Magic Water recipe.
	HoneyGlazedChips
	HoneyGlazedCarrots
	MoreHoney
	Pearl_Jam
	KK's Pizza
	StarJelly - Basic Staples does NOT have a Star Jelly recipe.
	StaxelCookieDough
		* Not useable in place of Staple's Cookie Dough because the game hates my attempts to make that happen.
	Waifu Bartending

***A non-conflicting mod has no recipes that directly interfere with Basic Staples. It may have different recipes that do the same thing, (like have a different method for making cheese,) but it doesn't cause any problems. Most of these mods either add a method to craft a vanilla item, or add items that Basic Staples doesn't have. It's possible some of these may move to another category if they're updated with new items or Basic Staple's roadmap changes. 

---------

Unsupported Mods****:
	auto baker/boiler/fryer/mixer/chopper:
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
	Autokitchen by NiccyNeko:
		* Automated Recipes have not been added yet.
	Coffee in Staxel:
		* Coffee Maker would require significant editing to be compatable with Basic Staples coffee.
		* Maybe someday.
	Dairy:
		* Lots of overlap with Basic Staples. 
		* Full compatability will require coordination with Ro-Z.
		* Even partial compatability will be a large project.
	Expanded Recipes:
		* Full compatability will require coordination with 09Iraida.
		* Partial compatability will be a large project.
	

****An unsupported mod either has fundamental and irreconcilable differences with Basic Staples and/or the mod author has specifically asked Mod Bucket not to pursue compatability with their mod. (Or we just haven't gotten to making patches yet!) There may be recipe conflicts, or there may not be. Any issues arising from an unsupported mod will probably not be pursued.
