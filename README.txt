Basic Staples
Version 1.2.1

A mod for Staxel.

==========

What is Basic Staples?

That depends on who you are. 

If you're a player, it's a mod that fills in the holes in the cooking system of Staxel. It will let you bake bread, make cheese, and has recipes that use every basic crop in the game. If you have other mods installed that Staples supports you may find new recipes that combine ingredients from multiple mods. At the same time: Staples won't clog up your catalog with useless ingredients. If you can lay your hands on it then there should be a recipe that can use the item. If you're a player, that's pretty much all you need to know! Check the section on pets just below this one if you aren't happy with the tweaks to pet gifting behavior. If you're concerned about compatability see the section after that. Go have fun!

If you're a modder, Staples gives you access to new ingredients from other mods that it supports without needing to release weird compatability patch mods. It doesn't give you access to most things that would be considered an "end product" unless that could reasonably be used to make something else (Like how carrot cakes can be made into a wedding cake in vanilla Staxel.) For how the system works see the ForModder.txt file in the same folder as this readme.

What's going to happen with Basic Staples in the future?

In the future as new mods are released Staples will add ingredients and new recipes. Basic Staples will never have quest content and is essentially in as finished a state as a core mod like this can ever be. It will continue to grow as a resource for players and modders alike so your villagers will always have delicious and intriguing food!

Mod Bucket has also folded our Farm animals mod into Basic Staples so you may find new animals from time to time too!

==========

On Pets:

This mod adds patches to the pet files so that they will each drop ONLY their own special kind of pet seed. Patches are included for the dragon pet, Auto Magic and Xable's pet mods. If you want the Bunny Carrot, Puppy Potato, and Cat Turnip to be dropped by all pets then delete the PetPatches folder or the subfolder for any mod you don't want affected. The vanilla pet treasure list has been patched to add the bunny carrot and puppy potato to the standard pet gift list. (That patch isn't in the PetPatches folder so you don't need to worry about accidentaly deleting it.)

==========

On Farm Animals:

Basic Staples changes the Rooster and adds several new animals.

Rooster:
	* The rooster is no longer constantly starving.
	* He eats chicken feed.
	* He drops chicken (meat).

Angus:
	* Eats fodder from a hay trough like normal cows.
	* Drops beef.
	* Doesn't give milk.
	* Drops splats.

Elephant:
	* Drops Peanuts and Elephant splats which can be turned into valuable coffee.
	* Eats Elephant Food
	* Needs a Special Trough
	* Has a cookbook with all pertinent Recipes.
	* Unlocks after coffee seeds are sold in stores.

Chick:
	* Purely decorative.
	* Drinks water from troughs or pet bowls.
	* Fill troughs or bowls with Water Jars.

==========

On Patches:

This mod adds patches for interaction with some other Mods. You can see the lists below. If you are running a mod in the Fully Supported or Partly Supported categories you'll want to go to the "mods/Basic-Staples/VoluntaryPatches" folder. Check through these folders for any notes or instructions if you see a mod you're playing with. 

==========

Mods Basic Staples interacts with:

Fully Supported*:  
	Easter Fest:
		* Patches out a few duplicate recipes and cloned some ingredients and the bunny carrot. 
		* Eggwood is not a food crop and will never be cloned.
		* Filligree Rabbits already only drop bunny carrot seeds. 
		* The Easter Fest plant is patched to drop Basic Staples Bunny Carrots. 
		* You might wind up with two stacks of bunny carrot seeds. Both produce the same crop item.

*A fully supported mod has patches to ensure no conflicting recipes and might have copies of ingredients and crops placed within the Basic Staples mod to make them accessible to other mods. ALL OBJECTS OR ITEMS CONTAINED IN BASIC STAPLES ARE HERE WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE ORIGINAL MODDER AND THEIR WORK IS LISTED IN THE CREDITS SECTION.

---------

Partly Supported**:
	
	OilC:
		* OilC oils may or may not work if another mod decides to use oils other than "cooking oil."
		* OilC's crusher will make Staples's oils. 
		* The Crusher is much more efficent than Staple's mill so there is incentive to use it.
		* Sell any OilC oil you have for profit.

	StaxelBasicRecipes:
		* Removed conflicting flour reactions and hid recipes. 
		* Do not recommend using this mod's cocoa recipe. Fast to get you catalog chocolate early but not economical. 
		* The animal food recipes are entirely different. Flexibility!
	Auto Magic:
		* Patches added to tweak the pet tables.
		* DO NOT put any bookshelf in the building store except the vanilla shelf. Any other shelf will fail to stock items even if it meets totem requirements.
		* Automated Recipes will have to be released in a separate patch mod.

	Xable's Animals - Patches added to redirect the pet drop tables.
		* It's possible these patches won't work because there's a space in the Xable's Animal's name. 
		* This is a limitation of the patching system... but you might get lucky?

	Dragon Pets:
		* Added a patch so that the dragons use a special dragon table. (not 100% this is working.)
		* Dragons drop all three pet seeds and treasures instead of clothing.(not 100% this is working.)

	Autokitchen by NiccyNeko:
		* Automated Recipes are in an experimental state.

**A partly supported mod might have some recipe conflicts with Basic Staples that have been patched out. Some items in the mod might be duplicates of Basic Staples items and the mod's recipes have been changed to produce or use Staples products. The mod may have ingredients that are unavailable for use with other mods. Mods that use Basic Staples might forget to include reactions for some of this mod's ingredients. 

---------

Non-conflicting Mods***:
	Allie's Kitchen Pickles - (Staples has no pickles at the moment. This will change.)
	HomesteadButter
	Homestead Magic Water - Basic Staples does NOT have a Magic Water recipe. No recipe is intended.
	HoneyGlazedChips
	HoneyGlazedCarrots
	MoreHoney
	Pearl_Jam
	KK's Pizza
	StarJelly - Basic Staples does NOT have a Star Jelly recipe. No recipe is intended.
	StaxelCookieDough - completely different recipe and behavior. It's an alternative.
	Waifu Bartending

***A non-conflicting mod has no recipes that directly interfere with Basic Staples. It may have different recipes that do the same thing, (like have a different method for making cheese,) but it doesn't cause any problems. Most of these mods either add a method to craft a vanilla item, or add items that Basic Staples doesn't have. It's possible some of these may move to another category if they're updated with new items or Basic Staple's roadmap changes. 

---------

Unsupported Mods****:
	auto baker/boiler/fryer/mixer/chopper:
		* These mods are no longer developed and probably won't be supported. (AutoBaker might be. Still considering.)
	Coffee in Staxel:
		* Maybe someday? It will take looking into.
	Dairy:
		* Lots of overlap with Basic Staples. 
		* Full compatability will require coordination with Ro-Z.
		* Even partial compatability will be a large project.
	Expanded Recipes:
		* Full compatability will require coordination with 09Iraida.
		* Partial compatability will be a large project.

****An unsupported mod either has fundamental and irreconcilable differences with Basic Staples and/or the mod author has specifically asked Mod Bucket not to pursue compatability with their mod. (Or we just haven't gotten to making patches yet!) There may be recipe conflicts, or there may not be. Any issues arising from an unsupported mod will probably not be pursued.

	- Added mint tea. Added it to Drinks book and repriced it.
	- Added toaster and coffeemakers to store shelves.

1.2
	- Fixed some random vanilla typos. 
	- Cocoa tree and related are now Cacao tree, etc until roasting as is proper.
	- Added a second method to get Buttermilk. (The proper method for real buttermilk, not the cultured stuff. At the moment they both point to the original Staxel buttermilk. Should we ever have reason to split buttermilk and cultured buttermilk the yeast recipe will change to cultured.)
	- Folded More Farm Animals into Basic Staples. (Added Elephant, Elephant Trough, Vanilla Black Ivory Coffee, Elephant Cookbook. Added Chick)
	- Added preliminary support for AutoKitchen and AutoMagic. Recipes for nearly everything (Easterfest recipes will not be automated except for melting eggs into chocolate bars at the moment.) These have only been spot checked. Automated recipes exist for everything, but not everything has a station capable of automation or has enough slots for Magic Powder.
	- changed how popsicle recipes work and changed how chocolate recipes are handles from start to finish to be a less confusing recipe.

1.1
	- Villager moddable like system is IN! Every giftable villager (aside from animals and quest only NPCs) has a system of category tags now. 
	- Each villager has three items from basic staples or vanilla that they now like to varying degrees. These items will likely change in the future once we've had time to see how the system works and what makes the most sense.
	- Added golden crops for EVERYTHING. Prices are good on seeds and produce.
	- Two new berry bushes: the Silverberry(Blueberry) and Brassberry(Blackberry). The Goldenberry now only comes from Raspberries and only reaps to Raspberry and Goldenberry seeds.
	- Golden Peanut is a rare drop from the Cornucopia. It's the only golden "crop" you can get from the cornucopia right now. It also drops when making peanut butter but it's a pretty rare drop. Should take about 200 peanuts?
	- Balanced seed prices for the normal crops that Staples added.
	- Added Peanut Butter, Chopped Cat Turnip, Chopped Bunny Carrot, Chopped Puppy Potato, Paw Crudites.
	- Fixed Mill crafting icon.
	- Fixed freezer door.
	- Added Mill and Freezer to store shelf.
