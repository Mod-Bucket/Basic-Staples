IF YOU AREN'T A MODDER STOP READING HERE. THIS STUFF IS BORING AND UNIMPORTANT TO YOU.

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================

For Modders:

First: If you have an item you want to add to Basic Staples so that the rest of the modding community can use it: Yay! Poke a Modbucket member on either the official or Mod Bucket discords (Probably Toketsupuurin as this is mostly maintained by her,) and they'll help you work through getting it into the mod.

Second: Basic Staples has been designed to win (almost certainly) any conflicts it has with another mod. It HAS to do this to fulfill its function of working with any mod that wants to play in its sandbox. If you have a recipe that desperately needs a single sweet potato being put in the blender to result in a potato mortar... well, sorry but everyone else needs the chopped sweet potato to cook food. If you're going to play in the sandbox, please respect the fact that other modders are/might be using this stuff too. If you're having a conflict like this: talk to a Bucketeer. We'll work with you to find a solution if we can, or we'll put your mod in the conflict list if we can't come to a mutually satisfying conclusion.

Third: Basic Staples has some items and recipes that don't appear to the player. All of these items have a patch file in:

mods\Basic Staples\PatchesToHideIngredientsNotCurrentlyUsed\

If you find an item you want to use, but it has a patch file in this folder make a patch to override the Staples patch. All the priority numbers in this folder are set to a very low priority so you should have no problems reversing the issue. 

     Some of these items will lose this patch file over time as enough recipes are added to Basic Staples to justify their visible addition to the core mod. This won't impact your mod. The item's code will never change and your patch will then just turn on an item that was already on.

	* Write a small patch file that changes at least one of these values to true:

	    "catalogueUnlockedFromStart": false, //players get instant access
	    "appearsInCatalogue": false, //Can't be bought from the catalog ever. Can be obtained other ways.
	    "buyable": false, //Players can buy it from the catalog. They can also buy it from a store if you change the store's pool contain it.
	    "searchable": false, //players can find it in the creative menu.
	    "canBeEarntFromLuckyBox": false, //A lucky box will drop 1 of this item ONCE only if the player has never seen it. This will unlock it in the catalog if the item has buyable set to true.

	ONLY include a value you NEED to change. NEVER make a patch setting a value to false. Don't include any others. Set your patch's priority to "3" or higher, and the merge option to "true" unless you know what you're doing. Bear in mind, other mods need access to these items too so don't go changing other stuff that impacts an item's behavior. You can probably get away with changing the value or sell price, but don't assume those aren't changed by someone else. If you need a special version of an item for a quest that needs other attributes changed It's probably better to create a new item and link to the Basic Staples QB file.

Patches are applied in sequential order so first comes the original file, then a patch of priority "2", then priority "3", etc. Keep your patch numbers as low as possible.

On Dummies and Random Reaction Outputs:

Basic Staples has several Dummy items that are completely worthless. They don't do anything and a player cannot access them under any circumstances. They exist PURELY for acting as placeholders in recipes that could take multiple options. So if you have a recipe that wants jam or a fish but you don't care which the player uses then use the appropriate dummy item in the recipe (This should probably be a final step in a recipe. The game might not register step completion if you use these. I can't do anything about it.)

If you use a dummy item in a recipe you'll have to make individual reactions for every/most entries in the category. This can get extremely time consuming. Pick the most appropriate dummy for your task or copy one and rename the code to something suited to your needs.

If the output of a reaction is generic (Say, an actual peanut butter and jelly sandwich that will take any jam) then you might be able to get away with it being an intermediate recipe step. (Combine PB&J with generic jam > Fry PB&J) but if you want PB & Strawberry Jam Toasted sandwich or PB & Grape Jelly toasted sandwich the recipe will fail to advance past the first combine dummy step because the player won't have made the dummy sandwich.

You can have a dummy input at any time as long as you're not trying to make the dummy item the recipe depends on in THAT recipe.

You can only have a dummy output as the last step in a recipe.

If I wanted a recipe for Any Toasted PB&J I'd have to separate it into two recipes:

Combine PB&J > 2 bread, peanut butter, Any Jam > Any PB& J.
Toasted PB&J > Fry butter, Any PB&J > Any Toasted PB&J. 

You'll need to make a dummy reaction for the recipe to point to that uses the dummy item.

The CheeseCloth recipe has an example of how a Dummy Item works. The text of the name is in the Basic-Staples.lang file.

If a reaction has a treasure drop rather than giving a single item it can cause problems if it's not the last step in the recipe. Anything that does this should either be the final step in a recipe, or a staple that's super obvious to make like something using the mill or the chopper machines.

Currently milling peanut butter and using the butter mixing recipe both drop multiple items. This isn't a real problem as you can simply call for butter, buttermilk or peanut butter and assume the player will know how to make or obtain them.

On Villager Likes:
	Every villager now has a set of category tags specifically for them that tells them how to feel about an item. They are as follows:

          Loves (+5)
          Likes (+3)
	  Ok    (+1)

	A loved item will get you their "Oh this is awesome!" dialogue.
	These three tags are probably the most useful options for gift giving so they're the ones that have been made. If you want something for a one off that gives another value, adding an individual like or dislike isn't hard. Should you feel the need for an entire additional tag category, (say, a dislike option) please let us know. Adding one won't be difficult now that the system is set up. 

	The tags have been obfucated with long, bizzare search terms so that a user can't just type a character's name or "loves" into the search box and get a list of hits. For the files with the category tags to use see:

mods\Basic-Staples\item\dummy\VillagerConcepts\

These dummy items are unsearchable and unobtainable in game. If you activate them they'll act as cheat items. This is not recommended.	

Note that a player who knows the search term to look for can still cheat and search for these terms in the box. If you don't want them to be able to do that then you should make your own patch that specifically defines the items you want them to have opinions about.

Mini-crafters:
	Mini crafting machines (like the toaster and coffee maker) are designed to be set on kitchen counters and automate some basic functions. They also have cheaper recipes at the cost of counter space and keeping track of another crafting machine.

Coffee recipes are usually boiled, and a boiled recipe should require a jar of water. The makers don't require water. A coffee recipe requires requires at least one "percable" item. Any grounds should be labeled "percable".

Toast is usually fried, and the fried recipe requires butter. No butter is needed for the toaster. A toastable item requires the term "toasting"

Actually Adding Basic Staples items to your mod:

If you just want to use a Basic Staples item in your mod there are a few ways to go about it:

1. Make your mod dependent on Basic Staples. This is the best option by FAR. You can use any visible basic staples items normally and you can assume that any of the visible Staple recipes are available for your player. Add in patch files to activate any items or recipes you want your players to see. (PLEASE ONLY activate items you'll be actually using to make stuff in your mod. Don't flood the player with useless items.)

2. Make your mod independent of Basic Staples. DON'T do this for critical features of your mod. Do this only when the stuff that uses Basic Staples is like bonus content. This is NOT a preferred option, but there are circumstances where it might be acceptable to pursue, like if it's an already established mod. If you poke a Bucketeer we can look into the possibility of adding a reciprocal patches. To see how this option works look into how the Giant Sugar Eggs are handled between Basic Staples and Easter Fest. (We really want to avoid doing this if we can. It's a headache.) 

Caveats for specific ingredients:

We've tried really hard to avoid duplicate items in Basic Staples from other mods. It was inevitable that it would happen at some point though. Some mods Basic Staples will just tweak so that their recipes output a Staple product...but if the mod is small enough and it only produces 1-2 items then Staples would overwrite the entire mod so we didn't take that route.

(In the Future) Pickles: Any recipe that uses a "pickle" should probably have a variation for the pickle from Allie's mod. Technically Allie's pickles are fermented and Staple's pickles are "quick pickles" so they would be different  products in reality. If you have a good reason not to make them equivalent, (like having recipes for both kinds of pickle,) then don't. But if you just want some random form of pickle then make duplicate reactions but only a single recipe. (You shouldn't make a Dummy for this. Just tell the player to use a "Pickle" and give the game two reaction files that point to the tw different pickles.)

Corn Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Corn Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Sunflower Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Sunflower Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Cookie Dough: Any recipe that uses cookie dough should probably have a variation for the dough from StaxelCookieDough.
