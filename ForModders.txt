IF YOU AREN'T A MODDER STOP READING HERE. THIS STUFF IS BORING AND UNIMPORTANT TO YOU.

For Modders:

First: If you have an item you want to add to Basic Staples so that the rest of the modding community can use it: Yay! Poke a Modbucket member on either the official or Mod Bucket discords (Probably Toketsupuurin as this is mostly maintained by her,) and they'll help you work through getting it into the mod.

Second: Basic Staples has been designed to win (almost certainly) any conflicts it has with another mod. It HAS to do this to fulfill its function of working with any mod that wants to play in its sandbox. If you have a recipe that desperately needs a single sweet potato being put in the blender to result in a potato mortar... well, sorry but everyone else needs the chopped sweet potato to cook food. If you're going to play in the sandbox, please respect the fact that other modders are/might be using this stuff too. If you're having a conflict like this: talk to a Bucketeer. We'll work with you to find a solution if we can, or we'll put your mod in the conflict list if we can't come to a mutually satisfying conclusion.

Third: Basic Staples has some items and recipes that don't appear to the player. All of these items have a patch file in:

mods\Basic Staples\item\crafting\PatchesToHideIngredientsNotCurrentlyUsed\

If you find an item you want to use, but it has a patch file in this folder make a patch to override the Staples patch. All the priority numbers in this folder are set to a verty low priority so you should have no problems reversing the issue. 

     Some of these items will lose this patch file over time as enough recipes are added to Basic Staples to justify their visible addition to the core mod. This won't impact your mod. The item's code will never change and your patch will then just turn on an item that was already on.

	* Write a small patch file that changes at least one of these values to true:

	    "catalogueUnlockedFromStart": false, //players get instant access
	    "appearsInCatalogue": false, //Can't be bought from the catalog ever. Can be obtained other ways.
	    "buyable": false, //Players can buy it from the catalog. They can also buy it from a store if you change the store's pool contain it.
	    "searchable": false, //players can find it in the creative menu.
	    "canBeEarntFromLuckyBox": false, //A lucky box will drop 1 of this item ONCE only if the player has never seen it. This will unlock it in the catalog if the item has buyable set to true.

	ONLY include a value you NEED to change. NEVER make a patch setting a value to false. Don't include any others. Set the patch's priority to "20", and the merge option to "true" unless you know what you're doing. Bear in mind, other mods need access to these items too so don't go changing other stuff that impacts an item's behavior. You can probably get away with changing the value or sell price, but don't assume those aren't changed by someone else. If you need a special version of an item for a quest that needs other attributes changed It's probably better to create a new item and link to the Basic Staples QB file.

On Dummies:

Basic Staples has several Dummy items that are completely worthless. They don't do anything and a player cannot access them under any circumstances. They exist PURELY for acting as placeholders in recipes that could take multiple options. So if you have a recipe that wants jam or a fish but you don't care which the player uses then use the appropriate dummy item in the recipe (This should probably be a final step in a recipe. The game might not register step completion if you use these. I can't do anything about it.)

If you use a dummy item in a recipe you'll have to make individual reactions for every/most entries in the category. This can get extremely time consuming. Pick the most appropriate dummy for your task or copy one and rename the code to something suited to your needs.

If the output of a reaction is generic (Say, an actual peanut butter and jelly sandwich that will take any jam) then you might be able to get away with it being an intermediate recipe step. (Combine PB&J with generic jam > Fry PB&J) but if you want PB & Strawberry Jam Toasted sandwich or PB & Grape Jelly toasted sandwich the recipe will fail to advance past the first combine dummy step because the player won't have made the dummy sandwich.

You can have a dummy input at any time as long as you're not trying to make the dummy item the recipe depends on in THAT recipe.

You can only have a dummy output as the last step in a recipe.

If I wanted a recipe for Any Toasted PB&J I'd have to separate it into two recipes:

Combine PB&J > 2 bread, peanut butter, Any Jam > Any PB& J.
Toasted PB&J > Fry butter, Any PB&J > Any Toasted PB&J.

Actually Adding Basic Staples items to your mod:

If you just want to use a Basic Staples item in your mod there are a few ways to go about it:

1. Make your mod dependent on Basic Staples. You can use any visible basic staples items normally and you can assume that any of the visible Staple recipes are available for your player. Add in patch files to activate any items or recipes you want your players to see. (PLEASE ONLY activate items you'll be actually using to make stuff in your mod. Don't flood the player with useless items.)

2. Make your mod independent of Basic Staples. DON'T do this for critical features of your mod. Do this only when the stuff that uses Basic Staples is like bonus content. You can safely do this with just reactions for hidden secrets for your players to find. Actually showing a recipe is trickier because if Basic Staples isn't installed the recipe will read incorrectly to the player, but if you poke a Bucketeer we can look into the possibility of adding a reciprocal patch into Basic Staples that will turn on a recipe. (This is not a preferred option, but there are circumstances where it might be acceptable to pursue, like if it's an already established mod.)

Caveats for specific ingredients:

We've tried really hard to avoid duplicate items in Basic Staples from other mods. It was inevitable that it would happen at some point though. Some mods Basic Staples will just tweak so that their recipes output a Staple product...but if the mod is small enough and it only produces 1-2 items then Staples would overwrite the entire mod so we didn't take that route.

Pickles: Any recipe that uses a "pickle" should probably have a variation for the pickle from Allie's mod. Technically Allie's pickles are fermented and Staple's pickles are "quick pickles" so they would be different  products in reality. If you have a good reason not to make them equivalent, (like having recipes for both kinds of pickle,) then don't. But if you just want some random form of pickle then make duplicate reactions but only a single recipe.

Corn Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Corn Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Sunflower Oil: Avoid using this directly. Cooking oil is preferred. If you use Sunflower Oil, bear in mind that a player might have OilC installed and you should make two versions of the reactions.

Cookie Dough: Any recipe that uses cookie dough should probably have a variation for the dough from StaxelCookieDough.
